# My Day

This app allows you to see your daily routine in a list.

Compatible with iOS 17.0+

- Events sorted by time
- Colors selectable by the user for each event
- Calculates the time between an event

I have some experience with Swift and SwiftUI so I learned from the project.

Note: The project was created for educational purposes and thus have comments/descriptions

## Purpose
- A plan to view the schedule of your own day

## Goals
1. List with a schedule
2. Users could add a title, time and color
3. Events should be saved persistent in the app
4. The app is localized in English and German

## Requirements
- Using Swift and SwiftUI
- G1, G2 make the UI with SwiftUI
- G1, G2, G3 Use a database (SwiftData)
- G4 Translate all strings
